# A-first-look-at-a-neural-network-Francois-Chollet
 A first look at a neural network (Deep Learning With Python, Francois Chollet Coursework). Let’s look at a concrete example of a neural network that uses the Python library Keras to learn to classify handwritten digits. The problem we’re trying to solve here is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (28 × 28 pixels) into their 10 categories (0 through 9). We’ll use the MNIST dataset, a classic in the machine-learning community, which has been around almost as long as the field itself and has been intensively studied. It’s a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST in MNIST) in the 1980s.
